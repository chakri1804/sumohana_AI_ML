### Just a practice of Tensorflow and GANs

The code here has been borrowed majorly from wiseodd's GitHub
Just to get familiarised and slight changes in architecture to tf.slim

Note-to-self:
~~~
Conditional GAN is basically Vanilla GAN but input data is concatenated with labels for 
generating data by labels
