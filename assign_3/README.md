### Please execute all the codes in Python 3. Text input for choosing options fails in Python 2.

#### For SVM code
Processor architecture difference might cause timing issues. For example, in some laptops with Intel processsor took less time to complete the dual form solution where as some AMD processsor systems took significantly long time to optimize (around 100 seconds)

#### For MLP code
For the operation input, give it in caps and in text form

xor => XOR
and => AND
or  => OR

Optimal test case ==>

Number of Hidden nodes = 4
Number of training samples per bit pair = 100
Std. Dev for noise = 0.001
Number of epochs = 300
learning rate = 0.01
